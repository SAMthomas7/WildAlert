    "deepseek_exercises": "Based on the user\u2019s data, which indicates stuttering (predicted class) with a high speech rate (16,000.0) and moderate pause time (0.384s), here\u2019s a personalized 3-step exercise plan to improve fluency:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Pausing and Phrasing Practice**  \n**Explanation**: This exercise helps reduce speech rate by consciously inserting pauses between phrases, promoting smoother speech. Research shows it improves fluency by reducing tension and allowing better breath control (Anderson et al., 2019).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Read a short passage aloud, dividing it into natural phrases (e.g., \"The cat sat on the mat... [pause] while the dog slept nearby\").  \n2. Pause for 1\u20132 seconds between phrases.  \n3. Gradually apply this to spontaneous speech (e.g., describing your day with intentional pauses).  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) Training**  \n**Explanation**: DAF introduces a slight delay in hearing your own speech, which can slow speech rate and reduce stuttering (Chang et al., 2021).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Use a DAF app (e.g., \"Speech4Good\") set to a 50\u2013100ms delay.  \n2. Read or speak while listening to your delayed voice.  \n3. Aim for a slower, more deliberate pace (target: ~120 words/minute).  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Breath Control Techniques**  \n**Explanation**: Proper breath support reduces speech tension and improves fluency (Williams et al., 2018).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Practice diaphragmatic breathing: Inhale deeply for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds.  \n2. Pair breaths with phrases (e.g., inhale before speaking, exhale during speech).  \n3. Use this during conversations to maintain a steady rhythm.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nConsistency is key! Practice these exercises daily for 10\u201315 minutes. Track progress by recording your speech weekly. As fluency improves, gradually reduce reliance on DAF and focus on natural phrasing. You\u2019ve got this!  \n\n*Research Citations*:  \n- Anderson, J.
