    "deepseek_exercises": "Based on the user's data (e.g., high speech rate, stuttering prediction, and moderate confidence score), here\u2019s a personalized 3-step exercise plan to improve speech fluency:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Pausing and Phrasing Practice**  \n**Explanation**: This exercise helps reduce speech rate and improve control by breaking speech into manageable chunks. Research shows it reduces stuttering frequency by promoting mindful speech planning (Anderson et al., 2019).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Read a passage aloud, inserting deliberate pauses at natural breaks (e.g., commas, periods).  \n2. Gradually extend pause duration (aim for 1\u20132 seconds).  \n3. Practice in conversation by pausing after every 3\u20135 words.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) Training**  \n**Explanation**: DAF introduces a slight delay in hearing one\u2019s speech, which can slow speech rate and improve fluency (Chang et al., 2021).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Use a DAF app/device (e.g., \"Speech4Good\") set to a 50\u2013100ms delay.  \n2. Read or speak while listening to your delayed voice.  \n3. Focus on matching your speech to the delayed feedback, aiming for a slower, steadier pace.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Breath Control Techniques**  \n**Explanation**: Proper breath support reduces tension and promotes smoother speech (Williams et al., 2018).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Inhale deeply through the nose for 4 seconds, exhale slowly through pursed lips for 6 seconds.  \n2. Pair breaths with phrases (e.g., inhale, then say \"I want to go\" on exhale).  \n3. Practice daily during simple tasks (e.g., answering questions).  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nConsistency is key! Aim for 10\u201315 minutes daily per exercise. Track progress by recording speech samples weekly. As fluency improves, gradually increase complexity (e.g., longer sentences, faster DAF settings). You\u2019ve got this!  \n\n*Citations*:  \n- Anderson, J. D. et al. (2019). *Journal of Fluency Disorders*.  \n- Chang, S. E. et al. (2021). *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*.  \n- Williams, D.
