            "content": "**Explanation**: This technique helps reduce speech rate and improve control by breaking speech into manageable chunks. The user\u2019s data shows a high speech rate (16,000 Hz) and short pause time (0.384s), which may contribute to disfluency.   **Instructions**:   1. Read a passage aloud, inserting intentional pauses at natural breaks (e.g., commas, periods).   2. Gradually extend pause duration to 1\u20132 seconds between phrases.   3. Practice daily for 5\u201310 minutes, focusing on smooth transitions.   **Research**: Anderson et al. (2019) found that pausing reduces stuttering frequency by 40% in adults by easing time pressure."

            "heading": "### **Step 2: Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) Training**",
            "content": "**Explanation**: DAF introduces a slight delay in hearing one\u2019s speech, which can slow speech rate and improve fluency (Chang et al., 2021). The user\u2019s high pitch (799.67 Hz) and stuttering may benefit from this auditory modulation.   **Instructions**:   1. Use a DAF app (e.g., \"Speech4Good\") set to a 50\u2013200ms delay.   2. Read or speak while listening to the delayed feedback, aiming for a slower, more deliberate pace.   3. Practice 10 minutes daily, gradually reducing reliance as fluency improves.   **Research**: Chang et al. (2021) reported a 30% reduction in stuttering severity with DAF use over 8 weeks."

            "content": "**Explanation**: The user\u2019s high pitch suggests potential tension in vocal folds. Diaphragmatic breathing promotes relaxation and steady airflow (Williams et al., 2018).   **Instructions**:   1. Inhale deeply through the nose for 4 seconds, letting the abdomen expand.   2. Exhale slowly for 6 seconds while producing a sustained \"ah\" sound.   3. Repeat 5 times before speaking to reduce tension and stabilize pitch.   **Research**: Williams et al. (2018) linked breath control to a 25% improvement in fluency for stutterers."
