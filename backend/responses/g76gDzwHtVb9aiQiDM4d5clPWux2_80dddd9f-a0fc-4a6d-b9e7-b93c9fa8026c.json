    "deepseek_exercises": "Based on the user's data (e.g., high pitch, stuttering prediction, and moderate pause time), here\u2019s a personalized 3-step exercise plan to improve speech fluency:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Pausing and Phrasing Practice**  \n**Explanation**: This exercise helps reduce speech rate and improve control over pauses, which can mitigate stuttering by allowing more deliberate speech planning (Anderson et al., 2019).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Read a short passage aloud, but intentionally insert brief pauses at natural breaks (e.g., after commas or clauses).  \n2. Gradually extend pauses to 1\u20132 seconds while maintaining a steady rhythm.  \n3. Practice daily for 5\u201310 minutes, focusing on smooth transitions between phrases.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) Training**  \n**Explanation**: DAF introduces a slight delay in hearing one's own speech, which can slow speech rate and reduce stuttering (Chang et al., 2021).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Use a DAF app or device set to a 50\u2013100ms delay.  \n2. Read or speak while listening to your delayed voice, aiming for a slower, more deliberate pace.  \n3. Practice for 5 minutes daily, gradually reducing reliance on the tool.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Breath Control Techniques**  \n**Explanation**: Proper breath support stabilizes speech flow and reduces tension, aiding fluency (Williams et al., 2018).  \n**Instructions**:  \n1. Inhale deeply through the nose for 4 seconds, then exhale slowly while saying a phrase (e.g., \"I can speak clearly\").  \n2. Focus on maintaining steady airflow during speech.  \n3. Repeat 10 times daily, gradually increasing phrase length.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nConsistency is key! Practice these exercises daily for 4\u20136 weeks, then reassess progress. Consider working with a speech therapist for personalized feedback. You\u2019ve got this!  \n\n*Citations*:  \n- Anderson, J. D. et al. (2019). *Journal of Fluency Disorders*.  \n- Chang, S.
